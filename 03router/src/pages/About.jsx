              Hello! I'm Krish, a passionate and dedicated web developer
              with over 3 years of experience in building dynamic and responsive
              websites and web applications. I specialize in frontend and
              backend development, ensuring a seamless user experience and
              robust functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have hands-on experience with modern JavaScript frameworks like
              React, as well as backend technologies such as Node.js and
              Express. I'm constantly learning and exploring new tools to stay
              up-to-date with the ever-evolving world of web development.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe in clean, maintainable code and the importance of
              collaborating with other developers and designers to create
              efficient, scalable solutions. I'm passionate about making the web
              a better place through thoughtful and user-centric design and
              development.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects,
              learning new technologies, and staying active in the web
              development community. Iâ€™m always open to new opportunities and
              collaborations, so feel free to reach out to me!
